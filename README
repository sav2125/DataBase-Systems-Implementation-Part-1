Run the code as : 
gcc -g main.c -lm -w -o main
./main K P 9 5 9

Checked error conditions for build tree by calculating min and max keys for a given fanout configuration.
Build Tree : 
Set insertion flags of all levels to True
For each key:
	from leaf level to root level:
		if (insertion flag == true):
			INsert in tree
			if (node full)
				insertion flag = 0 for that level
			Set insertion flag = 1 for all levels below current level

Append INT_MAX based on 2 conditionts : 
1: if (number of keys mod fanout_level-1) < fanout_level - 1
	append INT_MAX to complete node
2. if (lower_level node has no parent)
	BUild parent. append INT_MAX to parent node

Find range for probe : 

for each probe:
	start from root to leaf level:
		perform binary search on current node. go to correct node in the lower level.
	find the index in the leaf level corresponding to the given probe.
	Map the index to the correct range.
The end
